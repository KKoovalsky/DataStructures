# Data structures

This repository contains some data structures which I use when coding in C.  
See `.h` files for interface details.

## Buflist

A list of buffers which is useful when e.g. handling network data transfer when payload is parted.

## Array

At this stage only generic array searcher is implemented.

## Doubly linked list

Generic implementation of doubly linked list.
